`addresses.xml` contains addresses in a simple XML encoding:

```xml
<addressbook>
    <address>
        <forename>x</forename>
        <surname>y</surname>
        <email>z</email>
    </address>
</addressbook>
```

`Addressbook.java` contains code to load and save instances of class 
`Address.java` to files. Please complete the missing code.

Your methods **must** use the STAX API to read and write files. 

Do not change the given code. Instead, you should interface your methods to the provided methods.

Remember that your output file should have proper formatting and indentation.
